# Recommendation-system

<h4>It would be optimal to execute this program in google colab.</h4>

### Purpose:-
 The purpose of this system is to allow users to get recommendations for their favourite shows and a further aim for anyone to find the best possible recommendation for any item as long as its data is specified in the .csv file .

### Libraries needed for the program are:-

1. import networkx as nx
2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3. import pandas as pd
4. import numpy as np
5. import math as math
6. import time

### Additional features to be added:-

- [ ] Add a GUI.
- [ ] Add more features which can be connected to the file(rather than just genre).
- [ ] Add a file uploader in the GUI to allow for different files to be used as well as the option to alter the options on which the recommendations must be searched.
- [ ] Allow for a search function in GUI to allow the user to view the titles of the websites from the .csv file.
